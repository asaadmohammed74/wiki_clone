This file defines a map of effects to texture IDs. Each effect entry contains display information for drawing the effect in the client, frame-by-frame, as well as the texture and 3D model associated with the effect. A map of effect IDs to C3 paths are located in [3DEffectObj.ini](Files/3DEffectObj.ini). A map of texture IDs to texture paths are located in [3dtexture.ini](Files/3dtexture.ini). In the 3DEffect.ini file, ASB refers to “alpha source blend” and ADB refers to “alpha destination blend”.
