These are the binary output (machine language) to TQ Digital's official server C++ source code. They do not contain the source code, but can be used to create a running private server of around patch 5065 or 5095. They are accompanied by a leaked database dump that has been translated from Chinese to English. Running these leaked server binaries and the database carries no fair use and is considered **extremely illegal**. In addition to being illegal to run, TQ Binaries are also **very exploitable**. Exploits such as the ones listed below make running TQ Binaries or playing on servers which operate on TQ Binaries very unpleasant.

### Do you run a TQ Binary Server?
If you run a private server founded on TQ Binaries, you should **close your server immediately**. The exploits listed above are incredibly damaging to your player base and should not be lightly disregarded. Alternatives for private servers running on patches 5065 to 5095 exist. You can find and download those sources from [this thread](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/co2-pserver-guides-releases/1690271-guide-popular-public-sources.html). Again, if you run a TQ Binary server, shut down immediately. Many servers which lasted years had to shut down for the very exploits you see above, **you are not an exception**.

### Report a TQ Binary Server
If you find that a server is using illegally obtained software such as TQ Binaries, you may report them by sending an [email](mailto:co@netdragon.com) to TQ Digital Entertainment's sister company NetDragon Websoft.
