### Communication Protocols
* [Google ProtoBuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) ([Example](Security/ProtoBuf))

### Security Ciphers
* TQ Client Asymmetric Cipher ([Example](https://gitlab.com/spirited/conquer/snippets/1840784))

### Security Protocols
* DH Key Exchange ([MsgDH](Packets/MsgDH))
* SRP6A ([MsgAccountSRP6Ex](Packets/MsgAccountSRP6Ex), [MsgLoginChallengeS](Packets/MsgLoginChallengeS), [MsgLoginProofC](Packets/MsgLoginProofC))
